    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        As a junior Flutter developer with 1+ years of experience, I have built high-quality Android, iOS, and web
        apps using Flutter, while also modifying and maintaining existing apps. I collaborate effectively with
        crossfunctional teams in an agile environment to deliver work according to set plans. My technical background
        enables me to develop and publish high-quality Flutter apps on any of the app stores. I am well-versed in the
        Dart language and possess a solid understanding of OOP and SOLID principles. Additionally, I have strong
        analytical and problem-solving skills, enabling me to work on new apps and modify existing ones with
        different structures and complexities. My experience with version control tools like Git, combined with
        excellent debugging and troubleshooting skills, makes me an excellent candidate for any Flutter development
        team.
